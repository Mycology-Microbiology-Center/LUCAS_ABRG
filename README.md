# Antibiotic-related microbial genetic machinery across pan-European soil metagenomes <img src='images/MMC_logo.png' align="right" height="100" />

This repository houses the source code related to the study of antibiotic synthesis and resistance genes, obtained using high-throughput sequencing to analyze environmental DNA from 658 metagenomic samples of topsoil, collected from various regions across Europe.  

The foundation for the study is based on the European Commission's [LUCAS Soil survey](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/lucas). 
These samples were uniformly collected across the European Union using a standardized protocol.
